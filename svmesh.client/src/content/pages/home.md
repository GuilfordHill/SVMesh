## What is a mesh?

A mesh is a decentralized network of devices that communicate with each other directly, rather than relying on a central hub or internet connection. This allows for greater resilience, as the network can adapt and reroute data even if some nodes go offline. We use low-power, long-range radio boards to create these connections, enabling devices to communicate over distances that traditional Wi-Fi or Bluetooth cannot cover. We currently utilize the Meshtastic open-source project to power our mesh network, which requires no amateur radio license.

## How do I get started?

To get started, you will need a node. These can be bought pre-built or built yourself using readily available boards. Consult our [getting started guide](/getting-started) before your make your purchase for some good options in both categories, and for help getting connected to the mesh for the first time.
