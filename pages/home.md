## What is a mesh?

A mesh is a decentralized network of devices that communicate directly with one another, without relying on a central hub or an internet connection. This architecture provides resilience, allowing the network to adapt and reroute traffic even when individual nodes go offline.

We build our mesh using low-power, long-range radio hardware, enabling communication across distances that traditional technologies like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth cannot reach. Our network is powered by the Meshtastic open-source project, which does not require an amateur radio license to use.

## What can it be used for?

As a community, the mesh is primarily used for casual communication. We regularly check in and say hello, including daily community check-ins at 9 pm. Beyond this, members have found a variety of private and experimental use cases, such as low-power position tracking, backup communications, and remote sensor data collection.

While Meshtastic is not a replacement for emergency communication systems, it can serve as a useful backup to more robust options like amateur radio. Above all, the mesh is a platform for experimentation and learning, whether that involves infrastructure planning, CAD design, firmware development, or software integration.

## How do I get started?

To get started, you will need a node. Nodes can be purchased pre-built or assembled using readily available development boards. Before making a purchase, we recommend reviewing our [Getting Started guide](/getting-started), which covers recommended hardware options and walks through the initial setup process.

## I want to join the community!

We’re glad to have you. Our community primarily connects through Discord and Facebook. Visit our [socials page](/socials) to join the conversation.

Our members are always happy to help newcomers get online for the first time, and joining the community is the best way to stay informed about events, network updates, and ongoing mesh development. We look forward to seeing you on the mesh.
