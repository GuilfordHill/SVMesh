SVMesh has compiled a list of recommended nodes to set as ignored on your devices. These nodes have been known to excessively transmit unnecessary telemetry, spam the mesh with messages, or other undesirable behavior. The SVMesh community has attempted to contact the owners of these nodes repeatedly and has not been successful. If you see one of the nodes listed below in your node database, **it is recommended to set your node(s) to ignore packets from them**, to incentivize action to alleviate the problematic transmissions.

::info[Affected Nodes]
If your node is on the list below and do not know why, or you have alleviated the transmission issues, please reach out on our [socials](/socials) so we can re-evaluate your entry.
